<h1>3D Web Portfolio</h1>

 ### [Original idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k&list=WL&index=2&t)

<h2>Description</h2>
I'm building an 3D Developer Portfolio using ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.

Throughout the project, I'm learning how to utilize ThreeJS, a powerful 3D graphics library, for rendering and animating 3D models. I'll also incorporate React Three Fiber, a popular library that will enable me to create stunning 3D graphics within a React environment.

To enhance the visual appeal of the portfolio, I'll implement TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS styling framework, and I'll use Framer Motion, the go-to library for adding captivating animations to React websites.

During the development process, I'm gaining proficiency in loading, creating, and customizing 3D models and geometries. Additionally, I'm learning how to work with different lights and manipulate the camera and object positioning within the 3D world.

To ensure the code's reusability and scalability, I'm implementing Higher Order Components (HOCs) and following industry-standard best practices. I'll also integrate a form on the website for visitors to send emails conveniently.

Furthermore, I'll focuse on creating a responsive design that performs well across various devices. I'll use techniques such as Suspense and Preload to optimize the site's performance and improve user experience.

By completing this project, I will have gained valuable skills in 3D web development using ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. My portfolio now showcases my expertise in creating visually stunning and interactive 3D websites.
